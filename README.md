## Original guide
I recommend you go [here](https://github.com/ssloy/tinyrenderer) to check out ssloy's guide and follow it yourself if you're interested in learning about this topic.

## About this repository
The basic goal is to create a very simple, opengl like renderer using ssloy's guide.

I have experience in graphics work in game related contexts (Unity and Unreal game engines) but want to understand fully how graphics rendering works from a basic level.

As I work through this project I plan to update this readme with notes, progress, and maybe extended goals if I get the hang of this.

### Small note
I am using github.dev for some of this for flexibility while away from my PC, so any commit inconsistancy may be from switching between this and PC as I tend to commit more often on the web interface.
